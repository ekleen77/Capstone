For the Data Science capstone project we were allowed to select a project from a few choices.  I chose the Starbucks project because I can see the real-world application of this situation.  I find it extremely interesting to use to data to attempt to predict human behavior.

I found this to be a very challenging and rewarding project from start to finish.  I wish I had more time to explore other aspects of the data and try out other machine learning algorithms.  One reason I like this project is that it really gives the student the ability to choose a direction to explore based on their own interests.
